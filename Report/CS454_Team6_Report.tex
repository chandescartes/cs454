\section{Introduction}
In web design, developers need the ability to make quick updates to websites while retaining prior functionality. The key part of the development process is automated testing, through which the key aspects of websites is tested. The elements of a website are found through XML Paths (XPaths), which allows for elements to be located through relative or absolute paths.\\
These XPaths are reliable in finding elements in a static documents, but they may be broken as a website's structure changes. A key problem in modern automated web testing is finding robust XPaths that
